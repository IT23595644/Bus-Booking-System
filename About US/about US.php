                An efficient transport system is the key for the betterment of a country. Although the transport system in Sri Lanka has seen many improvements over time, the bus ticket booking platform still lacks a significant technology advantage. Pens and papers are unable to cope with the massive booking requests from passengers all over the Island. 
                Since our inception, we have seen that the general public and tourists alike are not completely aware of bus timetables and how to find a bus, and where to find it. After using our platform, Around 100,000 people from all parts of the country have given us very positive feedback that the online bus ticket booking platform has improved their journey with efficiency and convenience, 
                two pertinent and fundamental factors necessary to improve Sri Lanka's transport system.
